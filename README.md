> *"I build for the love of the craft"*

Seasoned software engineer blending analytical thinking with intuitive insight. I draw inspiration from mythology, quantum physics, poetry, and Bandler & Grinder's NLP work to create technology that truly serves humanity‚Äîbuilt by a human, for humans.

## üöÄ What I Build

**Core Stack:**
- **Frontend**: React, Vue, JavaScript/TypeScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Python, API Design
- **AI & ML**: Custom agents, learning systems, intelligent tools
- **DevOps**: Cloud solutions, optimization, automation
- **Tools**: VS Code extensions, developer experience

## üß† My Approach

I believe the best technology emerges when we understand both the code AND the human. My work is informed by:

- **Neurolinguistic Programming** - Understanding how language shapes reality
- **Systems Thinking** - Seeing patterns and connections across domains  
- **Mythology & Archetypes** - Timeless wisdom for modern interfaces
- **Quantum Physics** - Embracing uncertainty and possibility
- **Poetry** - Finding elegance in expression and structure

This interdisciplinary lens helps me build systems that are not just functional, but intuitive, meaningful, and genuinely useful.
