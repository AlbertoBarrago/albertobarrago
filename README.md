# Hi, I'm alBz

Curiosity continues to guide me on this IT journey that began several decades ago. Attention to detail, the drive to challenge myself, and the desire to explore new branches emerging from new technologies and insights are all part of my DNA.
Driven by an insatiable hunger, I'm currently delving into the depths of AI. The deeper I go, the less I understand—but then again, even they don't fully know how they work...


## 🤝 Let's Collaborate (Maybe)

If you're building something that actually matters and you give a shit about doing it right, I'm interested. If you're chasing the latest framework hype or think "move fast and break things" means shipping garbage, save us both the time.

I'm here for elegant solutions to hard problems, not your startup's pivot-of-the-week or code that looks like it was written by a committee of monkeys. Clean architecture, real engineering, no bullshit.
