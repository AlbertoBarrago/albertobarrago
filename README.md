# Hi, I'm alBz

Software engineer blending analytical thinking with intuitive insight. 
Years of experience building across the stack, with a genuine passion for craft.


## 🤝 Let's Collaborate (Maybe)

If you're building something that actually matters and you give a shit about doing it right, I'm interested. If you're chasing the latest framework hype or think "move fast and break things" means shipping garbage, save us both the time.

I'm here for elegant solutions to hard problems, not your startup's pivot-of-the-week or code that looks like it was written by a committee of monkeys. Clean architecture, real engineering, no bullshit.
