# 👋🏻 Ciao!

*I build for the love of the craft*.

____

Driven by a mix of logic and intuition, I draw inspiration from myth, quantum physics, poetry and the PNL in the work of Bandler and Grinder. My goal is to build as a human, for other humans.

> I publish what I love, and I'm always open to genuine collaboration.
