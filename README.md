## Software Engineer

> *"I build for the love of the craft"*

Software engineer blending analytical thinking with intuitive insight.

## üöÄ What I Build

**Core Stack:**
- **Frontend**: JavaScript (Expert in Angular), TypeScript, HTML5, CSS3
- **Backend**: Proficient in FastAPI, Spring Boot, Flask, Express, Fastify
- **Database**: MongoDB, Oracle, MySQL
- **DevOps**: Docker, GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, CI/CD pipelines

- **Tools**: Git, GitLab, React Native, Ionic, Kafka, Postman


## üß† My Approach

I believe the best technology emerges when we understand both the code AND the human. My work is informed by:

- **Neurolinguistic Programming** - Understanding how language shapes reality
- **Systems Thinking** - Seeing patterns and connections across domains  
- **Quantum Physics** - Embracing uncertainty and possibility

This interdisciplinary lens helps me build systems that are not just functional, but intuitive, meaningful, and genuinely useful.
