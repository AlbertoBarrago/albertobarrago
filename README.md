> *"I build for the love of the craft"*

Software engineer blending analytical thinking with intuitive insight.

## 🚀 What I Build

**Core Stack:**
- **Frontend**: React, Angular, Vanilla
- **Backend**: Spring, Express, Flask, FastAPI
- **AI & ML**: Custom agents, learning systems, intelligent tools
- **DevOps**: Cloud solutions, optimization, automation
- **Tools**: VS Code extensions, dx

## 🧠 My Approach

I believe the best technology emerges when we understand both the code AND the human. My work is informed by:

- **Neurolinguistic Programming** - Understanding how language shapes reality
- **Systems Thinking** - Seeing patterns and connections across domains  
- **Quantum Physics** - Embracing uncertainty and possibility

This interdisciplinary lens helps me build systems that are not just functional, but intuitive, meaningful, and genuinely useful.
