# 👋🏻 Ciao!

*I build for the love of the craft*, not for political correctness.

Driven by a mix of logic and intuition, I draw inspiration from the structure of myth, the precision of quantum physics, the language of poetry, and the patterns in the work of Bandler and Grinder. My goal is to build as a human, for other humans.

> I publish what I love, and I'm always open to genuine collaboration.
